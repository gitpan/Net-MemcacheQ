README for Net::MemcacheQ
=========================

Net::MemcacheQ is a very basic client wrapper around IO::Socket::INET
designed to speak the MemcacheQ protocol as described at
http://memcachedb.org/memcacheq/

Motivation for this was the fact that there didnt seem to be anything
on CPAN related to MemcacheQ, except possibly things relating to
memcached, none of which explicitly state whether they work with
memcacheq or not.
